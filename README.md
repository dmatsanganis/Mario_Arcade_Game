# Super Mario Click Challenge: An Object-Oriented Arcade Game

Super Mario Click Challenge is a dynamic, interactive arcade game developed in C#, leveraging the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The game is inspired by the classic Super Mario franchise and introduces a modern twist to its gameplay mechanics.

## Gameplay Mechanics

The core challenge of the game is to accurately click on the animated Super Mario GIF, which moves across the screen in a non-predictable manner. Precision and speed are the key components for success.

## Difficulty Levels

To cater to a wide spectrum of players, the game offers two levels of difficulty:

1. **Easy**: Ideal for beginners, the GIF moves at a manageable speed, allowing players to familiarize themselves with the game dynamics.
2. **Professional**: Designed for experienced players, the GIF moves at a significantly higher speed, demanding quick reflexes and superior hand-eye coordination.

The difficulty levels are directly linked to Mario's movement speed, providing a diverse gaming experience based on the player's skill level.

## Leaderboard

Super Mario Click Challenge fosters competition by maintaining a leaderboard that records the high scores for each difficulty level. This feature encourages players to improve their skills and strive for the top spot.

## Additional Features

- **Pause Functionality**: The game incorporates a pause feature, enabling players to take short breaks without affecting their current progress.
- **Dynamic Background Music**: The game enhances the overall player experience by including a selection of background music tracks that vary based on the game's state.

This project exhibits a sophisticated application of OOP principles in game development, resulting in an engaging, user-friendly gaming experience.
